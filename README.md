# Forecasting the future of KNR Constructions

I in the group of 4 people conducted a comprehensive analysis of financial statements, market trends, and macroeconomic conditions,since it is a crucial step in understanding the current financial health and positioning of a business. This analysis involves delving into various financial metrics, such as revenue, expenses, profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, and leverage ratios, extracted from the company's financial statements. By scrutinizing these metrics, we were able to identify trends, assess the company's performance over time, and uncover potential areas for improvement or concern.

To ensure the robustness of the financial model, we conducted sensitivity analysis. This involved varying key assumptions and variables to understand how changes in these factors may affect the forecasted financial result of KNR Constructions.

As per above parameters we concluded that the company has a rating of 3.8 out of 5, which is a fairly good rating. Also the company is in its growth phase and delivering good returns for 5 years, but looking at the construction industry it seems that the company is lagging from its peers in some aspects, like a lower dividend payout ratio of 1.84% as compared to other construction companies.

As per our analysis on the basis of our estimated future stock price,ratio analysis and market sentiments associated with the stock during rh, the company is expected to grow in excess of 10% for the next 3-4 years. Therefore, it's feasible to invest in KNR Constructions for a long duration.
